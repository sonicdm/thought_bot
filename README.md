Thought bot: Kinda dumb therapy bot.
I made a bot that helped me put thoughts into perspective and turn them into a silly game concept instead of feeling overwhelmed.

## Usage
`python run.py`
```
Welcome to the Thought Bot.
###########################

What is your name?:User
Thought #1
##################################
A random thought enters your head:
##################################
Lets do that selfish thing that will hurt the people around me.


Its a Bad thought. How do you respond?
Choose an example that fits or type your own
##################################
#1: These things happen sometimes.
#2: I am grateful for the opportunity.
#3: I wish you the best.
#4: I am worth it.
#5: Things could be much worse.
Enter your response:Take a step back and try to see what you might do to someone.
###################################
You chose to think: Take a step back and try to see what you might do to someone.
That thought is a Good thought.

Pretty basic. Definitely no substitiute for getting real help for yourself.
