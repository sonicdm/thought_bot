These things happen sometimes.
This is just the same old story.
I am grateful for the opportunity.
I wish you the best.
Things could be much worse.
I am going to go do that anyways.
I dont need anyone else to have a good time.
These thoughts are not in charge of you.
I am worth it.
Don't take anything personally.
Everyone is dealing with their own story, it's not about you.
You will feel better if you ask.
