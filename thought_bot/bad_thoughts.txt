Everything sucks.
They should have picked me.
There is no point in trying.
I don't deserve it anyways.
Nobody cares about me.
I am unlovable.
I want {thing} but I don't deserve {thing} because I am {negative pronoun}.
There is something wrong with me.
I will never be as good as {name}.
Why aren't they texting me back?
What does {name} have that I don't?
Everyone else is happy but me.
Nothing good ever happens to me.
Who would ever love someone like me?
Lets get wasted because I cant face this {emotion}.
Lets do that selfish thing that will hurt the people around me.
